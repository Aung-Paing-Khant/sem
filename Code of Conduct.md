### Purpose and Scope
<p align="justify">
This Code of Conduct sets out the expectations, standards, and values that all members of the project team agree to uphold. It applies equally to every member regardless of role or responsibility, ensuring fairness and mutual respect throughout the lifecycle of the project.
</p>

### Professional and Respectful Collaboration
<p align="justify">
All members are expected to interact with one another in a professional and respectful manner. This includes listening to different viewpoints, encouraging constructive feedback, and resolving disagreements calmly and fairly. Maintaining a supportive atmosphere allows the team to work productively and with mutual trust.
</p>

### Work Distribution
<p align="justify">
Tasks should be allocated fairly, considering each member’s skills, workload, and availability. Members are encouraged to contribute equally and support one another in completing work. This ensures that no individual is overburdened and that progress reflects the collective effort of the entire team.
</p>

### Definition of Done
<p align="justify">
 A task will only be considered “done” when it has been fully implemented, tested, reviewed, and documented to the satisfaction of the team. This shared definition helps prevent misunderstandings, ensures consistent quality across all project deliverables.
</p>

### Commitment to Deadlines and Quality

Each member is responsible for completing assigned tasks within agreed timelines and to an acceptable standard of quality. Deadlines must be respected as they affect the progress of the whole project. If difficulties arise, members should communicate early so that the team can adjust plans and maintain overall progress.
