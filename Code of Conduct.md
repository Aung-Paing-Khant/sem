<h1 align="center">Code of Conduct</h1>

### Purpose and Scope
<p align="justify">
This Code of Conduct sets out the expectations, standards, and values that all members of the project team agree to uphold. It applies equally to every member regardless of role or responsibility, ensuring fairness and mutual respect throughout the lifecycle of the project.
</p>

### Professional and Respectful Collaboration
<p align="justify">
All members are expected to interact with one another in a professional and respectful manner. This includes listening to different viewpoints, encouraging constructive feedback, and resolving disagreements calmly and fairly. Maintaining a supportive atmosphere allows the team to work productively and with mutual trust.
</p>

### Work Distribution
<p align="justify">
Tasks should be allocated fairly, considering each member’s skills, workload, and availability. Members are encouraged to contribute equally and support one another in completing work. This ensures that no individual is overburdened and that progress reflects the collective effort of the entire team.
</p>

### Definition of Done
<p align="justify">
 A task will only be considered “done” when it has been fully implemented, tested, reviewed, and documented to the satisfaction of the team. This shared definition helps prevent misunderstandings, ensures consistent quality across all project deliverables.
</p>

### Commitment to Deadlines and Quality
<p align="justify">
Each member is responsible for completing assigned tasks within agreed timelines and to an acceptable standard of quality. Deadlines must be respected as they affect the progress of the whole project. If difficulties arise, members should communicate early so that the team can adjust plans and maintain overall progress.
</p>

### Responsibilities
* **Product Owner**: Define and communicate the product vision, set priorities in the product backlog, and ensure alignment between business goals and the development team’s work.
* **Scrum Master**: Facilitate fair communication, mediate conflicts, and ensure that everyone’s contributions are valued.
* **Team Members**: Follow this Code of Conduct at all times. Report violations immediately and respectfully.
* **All Contributors**: Hold each other accountable and remind teammates of these standards when necessary.

### Reporting and Accountability
* **Raising Concerns**: <span align="justify"> Concerns should be raised respectfully with the team, Scrum Master, or Product Owner, ensuring open and transparent communication. </span>
* **Constructive Feedback**: <span align="justify"> Feedback must always be constructive, focusing on solutions and continuous improvement rather than blame. </span>
* **Collective Responsibility**: <span align="justify"> All members are responsible for holding each other accountable and upholding this Code of Conduct. </span>
* **Confidentiality and Respect**: <span align="justify"> Sensitive issues should be handled with discretion, ensuring that the dignity and privacy of all members are respected. </span>
* **Escalatioin Process**: <span align="justify"> If issues cannot be resolved within the team, they should be escalated to the Scrum Master or Product Owner for mediation. </span>
* **Commitment to Improvement**: <span align="justify"> Reports of misconduct should be seen as opportunities for learning and growth, not as punishment, reinforcing a culture of trust and responsibility. </span>

### Consequences for violations
To maintain fairness and responsibility, the following steps may be applied:
1. **Friendly Reminder**
    * A gentle reminder from any teammate when a minor issue occurs (e.g., slightly late submission, small mistake).
    * Intended for first-time or unintentional issues.
    * Example: "Please remember to push your code before the deadline next time."
2. **Verbal/Written Warning**
    * Given if the same issue is repeated or if behavior/workflow negatively impacts the team.
    * Documented in meeting notes for transparency.
    * Covers:
        * Lateness to Meetings: more than twice without valid reason may lead to a warning.
        * Missed Meetings: unexplained absence may reduce participation marks and trigger a warning.
        * Behavioral Issues: disrespect, ignoring communication, or not following agreements.

3. **Friendly Fine**
    * A symbolic penalty to maintain accountability in a lighthearted but fair way.
    * Examples:
        * Bringing snacks or drinks to the next meeting.
        * Preparing extra documentation or slides.
        * Taking an additional minor supporting task.
    * Applied in cases such as:
        * Repeated lateness to meetings.
        * Low-effort work that affects progress.
        * Minor but recurring behavior issues.

4. **Escalation for Serious or Repeated Violations**
    * Task Reassignment:
        * If a member repeatedly fails to deliver on time, their task will be reassigned to another teammate.
        * Ensures that project progress is not delayed.
    * Mark Contribution Transfer:
        * The marks/credits for a reassigned task will go to the teammate who successfully completes it.
        * The original member will receive reduced or no marks for that portion, depending on their effort (0–50%).
    * Meeting-Related Penalties:
        * Continuous lateness or absence without reason may lead to a deduction of contribution marks in addition to reassigned responsibilities.
    * Behavioral Issues:
        * Repeated negative or uncooperative behavior (e.g., lack of communication, disrupting meetings, disrespecting teammates) may lead to reduced contribution marks.
